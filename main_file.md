1. Convex to the origin.
2. Do not intersect.
3. Higher indifference curves indicate higher utility.

---

### What happens when these properties are violated?

#### How do we get the demand curve?

- The demand curve shows the relationship between the price and the quantity demanded for the **same** good. 
- Here, we have a relationship between the quantities of two goods.
  
#### To derive the demand curve:
- **Price Consumption Curve (PCC)**: It is a locus of all equilibrium points when the price of good 1 changes.
- We can generate the demand curve from the PCC, which relates $( P_1)$ and $( x_1 )$.

#### Suppose $( P_1 )$ increases. What happens to the indifference curve?

- **Utility function** remains unchanged:  
  $$ U = U(x_1, x_2) = \text{constant} $$

- **Budget constraint**:  
  $$ M = P_1 x_1 + P_2 x_2 $$  
  Solving for $( x_2 )$:  
  $$ x_2 = \frac{M}{P_2} - \frac{P_1}{P_2} x_1 $$
  ![Internet connection required to fetch image](https://github.com/muzammilafroz/micro_notes/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-09-19%20201143.png?raw=true)

- As $( P_1 )$ increases, the budget line swings inwards, reflecting reduced purchasing power.

- The **PCC** represents the changing equilibrium as $( P_1 )$ varies.

---

### Deriving the demand curve:

- As $( P_1 )$ increases from $( P_1 )$ to $( P_1' )$ to $( P_1'' )$,  
  $( x_1 )$ decreases from $( x_1 )$ to $( x_1' )$ to $( x_1'' )$.


- **Is the demand curve always downward sloping?**  
  Not necessarily, but typically, the relation between $( P_1 )$ and $( x_1 )$ is downward sloping:
  
  $$ \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial P_1} < 0 $$

- Hence, the demand curve \( D \) is downward sloping.

---

### Market Demand:

- The market consists of several consumers.  
  **How do we derive the market demand curve?**  
  Through **horizontal summation** of each individual's demand curve.

---

### Production Behavior:

- We start with a **production function**:  
  $$ Q = f(z_1, z_2, \dots, z_N) $$  
  Simplified to:  
  $$ Q = f(K, L) $$  
  where \( K \) represents capital and \( L \) represents labor.

- **Short Run (SR) vs Long Run (LR)**:
  - In the SR, some inputs (like capital) are fixed.
  - In the LR, all inputs are variable.

---

### Short Run Production:
- **Law of Variable Proportion** (Returns to a factor):
  1. Stage I: Increasing returns to a factor.
  2. Stage II: Diminishing returns to a factor.
  3. Stage III: Negative returns to a factor.

- **Costs of Production**:
  - Fixed cost, variable cost, average cost, marginal cost.
  - The relationship between production stages and costs.

---

### Long Run Production:
- In the LR, all factors are variable, leading to different behavior for the firm.
  
  **Why study this?**
  - To derive the firm's supply curve, and subsequently, the market supply curve.

---

### Production Function Revisited:
- **Production function**:  
  $$ Q = f(K, L) $$

- **Cost constraint**:  
  $$ C = wL + rK $$  
  where \( w \) is the wage rate and \( r \) is the rental rate of capital.

- **Profit function**:  
  $$ \pi = P \cdot f(K, L) - wL - rK $$

  - Two variables: \( K \) and \( L \).
  - You get two first-order conditions (F.O.Cs) to determine equilibrium.

---

### Graphical Representation:
- **Isoquant**: Graphical representation of combinations of \( K \) and \( L \) that yield the same level of output.
- **Producer’s Equilibrium**: Derive the firm's supply curve from the equilibrium point.

---

### Market Supply:
- The total market supply is the horizontal summation of individual firm supply curves.

---

# Chapter 1 : Technology

To understand the technology of a firm, the production function is the easiest way to summarize it. General and useful ways to understand technology involve understanding firms' production possibilities.

### Measurement of Inputs and Outputs

A firm produces output from various combinations of inputs. Suppose:
- $( q )$ is the output,
- $( L )$ is labor,
- $( K )$ is capital.

We can express this relationship as:
$$ 
q = f(L, K) 
$$
For specific combinations:
- $( q = f(1, 2) )$
- $( q = f(2, 2) )$
- $( q = f(2, 1) )$

This representation shows the combinations of inputs and output that the firm is able to produce.

**General Argument:**
To study firm choices, we need a structured and convenient way to summarize the production possibilities of the firm.
## What are Production Possibilities?

Production possibilities refer to the combinations of inputs and outputs that are technologically feasible for a firm. This concept is crucial in understanding how firms utilize their resources efficiently to produce goods and services.

### Key Points:

1. **Inputs and Outputs**: 
   - In production, both inputs (like labor and capital) and outputs (the goods produced) flow over a specific period. 
   - For example, a certain amount of inputs are used to produce a specific quantity of output during that period.

2. **Time Dimension**:
   - When specifying inputs, it is essential to include a time dimension. 
   - For instance, labor can be measured in hours worked per week, while capital can be assessed based on the amount spent on machinery per month.
   - **Important Note**: It's crucial to use the same time unit for analysis to ensure consistency.

3. **Spatial and Temporal Nature of Production**:
   - Some aspects of production involve spatial and temporal considerations. 
   - For example, concrete that is available in a given year may be used to construct a building in the following year.
   - Similarly, concrete used in your city might have been sourced from a neighboring state. Therefore, the input "concrete" must be understood as available in a specific location at a particular time.

### Takeaway:
All these points are vital when analyzing producers' behavior and focusing on inputs and outputs. However, it is common for us to overlook these aspects in formal discussions. This oversight does not imply that these factors are unimportant; rather, it is often assumed that they are adequately accounted for in the analysis.

---

## Specification of Technology

The specification of technology provides a general framework that captures the same intuition but offers a different formalization for studying production behavior.

### General Framework:
- Consider a firm that has $n$ possible goods.
- This framework is general because it allows all $n$ possible goods to serve as inputs and/or outputs.

### Inputs and Outputs:
- It’s easy to think of examples where certain goods act purely as inputs or outputs.
- **Examples**:
  - In chemical production, heat can serve as both an input (for energy) and an output (as a byproduct).

### Notation:
- Let $y_j^i$ represent the units of good $j$ used as an input.
- Let $y_j^o$ represent the units of good $j$ produced as an output.
- The net output of good $j$ is given by:
$$ 
y_j = y_j^o - y_j^i 
$$
- If $y_j^o > y_j^i$, the firm is producing more of good $j$ than it is using.
- Conversely, if $y_j^o < y_j^i$, the firm is using more of good $j$ as an input (e.g., curd) and producing less of it (e.g., heat).

### Production Plan:
A production plan lists the net outputs of various goods. It can be represented as a vector:
$$ 
y = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_m) 
$$
where $y$ is in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

### Production Possibility Set (PPS):
The set of all technologically feasible production plans is called the Production Possibility Set (PPS), denoted as $Y$.
- $Y$ is obviously a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and describes all patterns of inputs and outputs that are technologically feasible, providing a complete description of the firm's technological possibilities.

### Examining Technological Possibility Set:
We may want to distinguish between production plans that are "immediately" feasible and those that are "eventually" feasible. This distinction aligns with the familiar discussion of the short run (SR) and the long run (LR).

#### Short Run vs. Long Run:
- In the short run, since some factors are fixed, production plans must take these restrictions into account.
- We will assume that all restrictions faced by the firm in the short run are described by a vector $z$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  - Think of $z$ as the list of the maximum amounts of various inputs and outputs that can be produced in the concerned period.

### Restricted Production Possibility Set:
We use a restricted production possibility set denoted by $Y(z)$ (in the short run, this is called the SR PPS).
$$ 
Y(z) = \{ y \in Y : Y_j = y_j \} 
$$
- Here, $Y(z)$ consists of all feasible net output bundles consistent with the set of restrictions.
- **Example**: If a factor is fixed at $y_n$ in the SR, then the SR PPS can be defined as:
$$ 
Y(\bar y_n ) = \{ y \in Y : y_n  =\bar y_n \} 
$$
### Conclusion:
The set $Y(z)$ is a subset of $Y$ because it contains all production plans that satisfy the additional conditions imposed by the input requirements.

## Input Requirement Set

Suppose a firm produces a single output, denoted as $y$, while the rest of the goods are inputs. We can denote the vector of inputs as $x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$. The production process can be expressed as the net output bundle $(y, - x)$, where $y$ represents the units of output produced.

A special case of the restricted production possibilities set is the input requirement set, denoted as $V(y)$. It is defined as:
$$ 
V(y) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n_+ : (y, -x) \in Y \} 
$$
This set describes the real space of $n$ dimensions in the positive space.

#### Properties of $V(y)$:
- $V(y)$ has two parts:
  1. All inputs are constrained in the positive real space.
  2. The net output bundle associated with these inputs is technologically feasible.
  
Thus, $V(y)$ is the set of all input bundles that can produce at least $y$ units of output.

### Important Note:
The input requirement set defines inputs as positive numbers, which is the opposite of how inputs are defined in the Production Possibility Set (PPS).

### Isoquant Definition
We can define an isoquant using the concept of the input requirement set. Let $V(y)$ be the set of all input bundles producing at least $y$ units of output.

For all input bundles that produce exactly $y$ units of output, we define:
$$ 
Q(y) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n_+ : x \in V(y) \text{ and } x \text{ produces exactly } y \text{ units of output} \} 
$$

### Example: Short Run Production Possibility Set (SR PPS)
Suppose a firm produces output from labor and capital. The production plan can be represented as $(y, -l, -k)$, leading to the PPS defined as:
$$ 
Y = \{ (y, -l, -k) \in Y \} 
$$

Now, if we can change the labor input but the capital is fixed at $\bar k$, then we have:
$$ 
Y(z) \rightarrow Y(\bar k) = \{ (y, -l, -k) \in Y : k = \bar  k \} 
$$
This shows how the production possibility set adjusts based on fixed and variable inputs in the short run.

---
### Production Function
If a firm produces one output, we define the production function as follows:
$$ f(x) = \{ y \in \mathbb{R} : y \text{ is the maximum output associated with } x \text{ in } Y \} $$
This function relates the input vector $x$ to the maximum possible output $y$ that can be produced by the firm.

### Transformation Function
The concept of a production function can be extended into a higher dimensional analog, known as the transformation function. It is defined as:
$$ T : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $$
The transformation function $T(y) = 0$ if and only if $y$ represents an efficient production plan.

#### What do we mean by "efficient"?
A production plan $y$ is said to be efficient if there is no other production plan $y'$ such that $y \leq y'$ and $y' \neq y$. In simple terms, this means that a production plan is efficient if there is no way to produce more output with the same inputs or produce the same output with fewer inputs.

### Recap of Notations:
- We began with a set of goods, indexed by $j = 1, 2, \ldots, n$.
- Let $y_j^o$ represent the amount of output of good $j$, and $y_j^i$ represent the amount of input of good $j$.
- The net output vector is $y = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n)$, where $y_j > 0$ for outputs and $y_j \leq 0$ for inputs.
- The Production Possibility Set (PPS) is denoted by $Y$, and it describes all feasible net output vectors.

### Examples:
1. **Production Plan:**
   A production plan is represented as $y = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n)$, where $y_j$ indicates the net output of good $j$.
   
2. **Short Run Production Possibility Set (SR PPS):**
   The SR PPS is restricted to certain inputs that are fixed in the short run. We denote the input requirement set as $V(y)$, and it represents all input bundles that can produce at least $y$ units of output.
   
3. **Production Function ($f(x)$):**
   The production function describes the maximum output that can be produced from a given input bundle $x$. For example, the Cobb-Douglas production function with inputs $x_1, x_2$ is given by:
   $$
   f(x_1, x_2) = A x_1^\alpha x_2^{1-\alpha}
   $$

4. **Isoquant:**
   The isoquant $B(y)$ represents all input bundles that produce exactly $y$ units of output. It is defined as:
   $$
   Q(y) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n : f(x) = y \}
   $$

### Cobb-Douglas Production Function Example:
Suppose a firm has two inputs, $x_1$ and $x_2$, and produces output $y$. The Cobb-Douglas production function is:
$$
f(x_1, x_2) = A x_1^\alpha x_2^{1-\alpha}
$$
The associated production plan is represented as $(y, -x_1, -x_2)$, and the production possibility set (PPS) is:
$$
Y = \{ (y, -x_1, -x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : y \leq A x_1^\alpha x_2^{1-\alpha} \}
$$
and the input requirement set:
$$
V(y) = \{ ( x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2_+ : y \leq A x_1^\alpha x_2^{1-\alpha} \}
$$
### Isoquant:
$$
Q(y) = \{(x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}_+^2 : y = x_1^a x_2^{1-a} \}
$$

### Suppose $x_2 = z$, Restricted Production Possibility Set:
$$
Y(z) = \{(y, -x_1, -x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : y \leq x_1^a x_2^{1-a}, x_2 = z \}
$$

### Transformation Function:
$$
T(y) = 0 \Rightarrow y - f(x) = 0 \Rightarrow y - x_1^a x_2^{1-a} = 0
$$

### Production Function:
$$
f(x_1, x_2) = x_1^a x_2^{1-a}
$$


### Leontief Technology Example:
In Leontief technology, the production function assumes perfect complements between inputs, and output is determined by the minimum of the scaled inputs. The production function is:
$$
f(x_1, x_2) = \min(a x_1, b x_2)
$$
$$
Y \rightarrow \{ (y,-x_1, -x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : y \leq \min(a x_1, b x_2) \}
$$
The input requirement set $V(y)$ is defined as:
$$
V(y) = \{ (x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2_+ : y \leq \min(a x_1, b x_2) \}
$$
$$
Q(y) = \{(x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}_+^2 : y = \min(a x_1, b x_2)  \}
$$
The transformation function $T(y, x_1, x_2)$ is:
$$
T(y, x_1, x_2) = y - \min(a x_1, b x_2)
$$

### Summary:
We have explored the key technical and formal methods used to describe various aspects of production possibilities. We will now focus on the description of the methods used. In this part of the course, we focus on the assumption that a firm is producing a single output, and much of the analysis revolves around describing the technology using the input requirement set $V(y)$ and the transformation function $T(y)$.

---
## Activity Analysis

This focuses on how to describe production processes. The simplest way to describe production using input requirement sets is to simply **list** them!

### Example:
Suppose we have an output good, produced using two factor inputs: **factor 1** and **factor 2**. There are two different activities or techniques by which this production takes place. To produce 1 unit of the output good, we can do either of the following:

1. **Technique 1**: 1 unit of factor 1 and 2 units of factor 2 $\rightarrow$ 1 unit of output.
2. **Technique 2**: 2 units of factor 1 and 1 unit of factor 2 $\rightarrow$ 1 unit of output.

Now, let's further define the goods:
- Suppose **output** is good 1.
- Input 1 is good 2.
- Input 2 is good 3.

### Production Possibility Set:
$$
Y = \{(1, -2, -1), (1, -1, -2)\}
$$

### Input Requirement Set:
For 1 unit of output, the input requirement set is:
$$
V(1) = \{(2, 1), (1, 2)\}
$$

Now, if I ask you, what is $V(y)$? That is, what is the set of feasible ways to produce $y$ units of output?

$$
V(y) = \{(y, 2y), (2y, y)\}
$$

Does this set include **all** relevant possibilities? **Not quite!** Why? 

- It is true that $(y, 2y)$ produces $y$ units if we use **technique A**.
- Similarly, $(2y, y)$ produces $y$ units if we use **technique B**.

But what if we use **a mixture of techniques A and B**?

### Accurate Input Requirement Set:
Let us try to formulate a more accurate input requirement set for $y = 1, 2, \dots$. Let:
- $Y_A$ be the amount of output produced by technique A.
- $Y_B$ be the amount of output produced by technique B.

The input requirement set for $y$ can then be written as:
$$
V(y) = \{(Y_A + 2Y_B, Y_B + 2Y_A): y = Y_A + Y_B \}
$$

So, for example:
- $V(1) = \{(1, 2), (2, 1)\}$
- $V(2) = \{(2, 4), (4, 2), (3, 3)\}$
- $V(3) = \{(3, 6), (6, 3), (5, 4), (4, 5)\}$

And so on...

Thus, for the given technological specification, the set:
$$
V(y) = \{(Y_A + 2Y_B, 2Y_A + Y_B): y = Y_A + Y_B \}
$$
is a more appropriate description of the input requirement set.

### Monotonic Technologies:
Now, let's focus on some properties of this input requirement set.

In this two-technique example, suppose we have an input vector of $(3, 2)$. Then, if I ask you: **Is this sufficient to produce 1 unit of output?**

Your answer should be **Yes!** Why?

Because **either technique 1 or technique 2** will allow us to produce 1 unit of output. However, we would need to dispose of the **extra** inputs along the way.

If such **free disposal** is allowed, it is reasonable to argue that:
- If $x$ is a feasible vector of inputs that produces $y$ units of output,
- Then, any input vector $x'$, with at least as much of each input as $x$, should also be feasible to produce $y$.

Thus, the input requirement set is **monotonic**:
$$
\text{If } x \in V(y) \text{ and } x' \geq x \text{, then } x' \in V(y).
$$
![Internet connection is required to fetch image](https://github.com/muzammilafroz/micro_notes/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-09-19%20201235.png?raw=true)
Similarly, for production sets:
- If $y \in Y$ and $y' \leq y$, then $y'$ is in $Y$.
- This means that production plan $y'$ produces equal or smaller amounts of output by using **at least as much** inputs as $y$.

Naturally, if $y$ is feasible, then $y'$ is **also** feasible.

---

## Convex Technologies

Now, using the same two techniques, suppose we want to produce **100 units** of output. The question arises:

**What will the input requirement set look like?**

The straightforward answer: We could **replicate** the process and thereby produce **100 times as much**.

Is this realistic? **Not always!**

Suppose it is realistic, then using $V(1) = \{(1, 2), (2, 1)\}$, we can replicate it for $y = 100$. This would give us the input combinations:
$$
V(100) = \{(100, 200), (200, 100)\}
$$

### Any other possible ways to produce 100 units of output?

Consider the following:
- **50 units of activity A** and **50 units of activity B**.
  
- **50 units of activity A** uses the combination $(100, 50)$.
  
- **50 units of activity B** uses the combination $(50, 100)$.

Hence, these combinations would use **150 units of input 1** and **150 units of input 2**. So, $(150, 150)$ should also be in $V(100)$.

### Another scenario:
Suppose we want to use the following combination:
- **25 processes of activity A**: $(50, 25)$.
- **75 processes of activity B**: $(25, 150)$.

Thus, the input combination $(125, 175)$ should also be in $V(100)$.

### Generalization:
Let’s make this more general. If we use a weighted combination of the two techniques, we get:
$$
t(100, 200) + (1-t)(200, 100) = (100t + 200(1-t), 200t + 100(1-t))
$$
This should also be in $V(100)$, where $0 \leq t \leq 1$.

This property is called **Convexity**.

### Convexity Property:
![Internect connection required to fetch the image](https://github.com/muzammilafroz/micro_notes/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-09-19%20201245.png?raw=true)
For the input requirement set $V(y)$, if $x$ and $x'$ are in $V(y)$, then any **convex combination** of $x$ and $x'$ is also in $V(y)$. Mathematically:
$$
tx + (1-t)x' \in V(y) \quad \text{for all } 0 \leq t \leq 1
$$
Thus, $V(y)$ is a **convex set**.

### Is convexity a reasonable assumption?

When scaling up from small to large outputs, **convexity** is a reasonable assumption. However, this can be questionable because, at times, the scale of the underlying activities may become **too large**.

Convexity may **not** be reasonable under certain assumptions but **may** be reasonable in other circumstances. For example:

- Suppose we measure output **per month**.
- If **activity A** produces $y$ units of output in one month, and **activity B** also produces $y$ units in one month, then we can split the processes.
- We can use **half** of activity A for the first half of the month and **half** of activity B for the second half, producing $y$ units of output.

### Convexity Assumption for Production Set:
If $y$ is in $Y$ and $y'$ is in $Y$, then the **convex combination**:
$$
ty + (1-t)y' \in Y \quad \text{for all } 0 \leq t \leq 1
$$
implies that $Y$ is a **convex set**.

### A Simple Property:
One simple property of a **convex production set** is that it implies a **convex input requirement set** as well.

### To Prove: If the Production Set $Y$ is Convex, the Associated Input Requirement Set is also Convex

### Statement:
We are tasked with proving that if the production set $Y$ is convex, then the associated input requirement set is also convex.

### Proof:

Let’s assume that $Y$ is a convex set. This implies that for any $x$ and $x'$, if $(y, x)$ is in $Y$ and $(y, x')$ is also in $Y$, then the **convex combination** of these points must also be in $Y$. This can be written as:
$$
(ty + (1 - t)y, -tx - (1 - t)x') \in Y \quad \text{for all } 0 \leq t \leq 1
$$

Now, if $(y, -x) \in Y$ and $(y, -x') \in Y$, it follows that the convex combination $(y, -tx - (1 - t)x') \in Y$. This implies that for the **input requirement set** $V(y)$:
$$
tx + (1 - t)x' \in V(y)
$$

Thus, the input requirement set $V(y)$ is **convex**, meaning that any convex combination of feasible input vectors is also feasible for producing the same level of output.

---

## Regular Technologies

### Regular Conditions for the Input Requirement Set $V(y)$:

A **weak regular condition** for the input requirement set $V(y)$ is that $V(y)$ should satisfy the following two properties:

1. **Closed**: The set $V(y)$ must be a closed set.
2. **Non-empty**: The set $V(y)$ should not be empty for all $y > 0$.

### Assumption 1: $V(y)$ is Non-empty
The assumption that $V(y)$ is non-empty requires that producing some output is **not trivial**. Specifically, we cannot assume that $y$ can always be produced without inputs. There must be some **conceivable way** to produce output.

### Assumption 2: $V(y)$ is Closed
If $V(y)$ is closed, it means that if we have a sequence of input vectors $\{x^i\}$, each of which can produce $y$ units of output, and if this sequence **converges** to some point $x^0$, then $x^0$ must also be capable of producing $y$.

In other words, the input requirement set must include its **boundary**. If inputs converge to a limit, that limit must also be feasible.

## Parametric Representation of Technology

### Introduction:
Suppose there are many possible ways to produce a given level of output. Instead of listing all possible input combinations, we can **smooth** the associated isoquants and represent the technology using **parametric functions**.

The smoothing of isoquants provides a **convenient way** to represent production technology through mathematical functions.

---

## Parametric Representations:
Some common parametric forms used to represent technologies include:
- **Cobb-Douglas production function**,
- **Constant elasticity of substitution (CES)**,
- **Leontief function**,
- **Linear functions**, and
- Others.

### Why Use Parametric Specifications?
The reason for applying a parametric specification to physical data is to use **pedagogic tools** such as **calculus** and **algebra**. These tools allow us to analyze production processes more rigorously.

Once we bring the discussion into the realm of algebra and calculus, we can explore more **algebraic properties** of production processes. This includes discussing concepts related to technology, isoquants, and input-output relationships.

---

### Conclusion:
In summary, if the production set $Y$ is convex, the input requirement set $V(y)$ will also be convex. Regular technologies must satisfy the conditions of being **non-empty** and **closed**, and parametric representations of production functions help simplify the analysis of complex production technologies.

---

## Technical Rate of Substitution (TRS)

### Assumptions:
Assume that we have a technology represented by a **smooth production function**:
$$ y^* = f(x_1, x_2) $$

This production function expresses the output $y$ as a function of two inputs, $x_1$ and $x_2$. Now, suppose we are at a particular point $(x_1^*, x_2^*)$ on the production function, producing a certain level of output $y$. The production function at this point is:
$$ y^* = f(x_1^*, x_2^*) $$

### Concept of TRS:
If we want to **increase the amount of input $x_1$** but **maintain the same level of output $y^*$**, we must **reduce the amount of input $x_2$**. This trade-off between the two inputs, while keeping output constant, is referred to as the **Technical Rate of Substitution (TRS)**.

TRS is **defined** as the amount of one input that has to be sacrificed to use an additional unit of the other input, while maintaining the same level of output.

### Interpretation:
TRS represents the **slope of the isoquant**. The isoquant is a curve that shows all possible combinations of inputs that produce the same level of output.

---

### Derivation of TRS:
There are two primary methods to derive the TRS.

---

### Method 1: Using the Implicit Function Theorem
Let $x_2(x_1)$ be the implicit function that tells us how much of input $x_2$ is required to produce $y$, using $x_1$ units of the other input.

Given the production function:
$$ f(x_1, x_2(x_1)) = y $$

Differentiate this with respect to $x_1$:
$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} \cdot \frac{dx_2}{dx_1} = 0 $$

Solving for $\frac{dx_2}{dx_1}$:
$$ \frac{dx_2}{dx_1} = -\frac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}}{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}} $$

Thus, the TRS is given by:
$$ \text{TRS} = \frac{dx_2}{dx_1} = -\frac{ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} }{ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} } $$

---

### Method 2: Using Total Differentiation
Consider the total differential of the production function:
$$ y = f(x_1, x_2) $$

Taking the total differential:
$$ dy = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} \cdot dx_1 + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} \cdot dx_2 $$

To maintain the same level of output $y$, we set $dy = 0$:
$$ 0 = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} \cdot dx_1 + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} \cdot dx_2 $$

Solving for $\frac{dx_2}{dx_1}$:
$$ \frac{dx_2}{dx_1} = -\frac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}}{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}} $$

Thus, the TRS is:
$$ \text{TRS} = -\frac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}}{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}} $$

---

### Examples of TRS for Different Production Functions

#### 1. TRS for a Cobb-Douglas Production Function
The Cobb-Douglas production function is given by:
$$ y = A x_1^a x_2^{1-a} $$

First, compute the partial derivatives:
$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} = a A x_1^{a-1} x_2^{1-a} $$
$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} = (1 - a) A x_1^a x_2^{-a} $$

Now, the TRS is:
$$ \text{TRS} = -\frac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}}{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}} = -\frac{a A x_1^{a-1} x_2^{1-a}}{(1-a) A x_1^a x_2^{-a}} $$

Simplifying:
$$ \text{TRS} = -\frac{a}{1-a} \cdot \frac{x_2}{x_1} $$

Thus, for a Cobb-Douglas production function, the TRS is proportional to the ratio of inputs, scaled by the factor $\frac{a}{1-a}$.

---

#### 2. TRS for a CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution) Production Function
The CES production function is:
$$ y = \left[ a_1 x_1^{\rho} + a_2 x_2^{\rho} \right]^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}} $$

The partial derivatives are:
$$
\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_1} = \frac{1}{(1 - \rho)} \left( a_1 x_1^{\rho} + a_2 x_2^{\rho} \right)^{\frac{1}{\rho} - 1} \cdot a_1 \cdot \rho \cdot x_1^{\rho - 1}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_2} = \frac{1}{(1 - \rho)} \left( a_1 x_1^{\rho} + a_2 x_2^{\rho} \right)^{\frac{1}{\rho} - 1} \cdot a_2 \cdot \rho \cdot x_2^{\rho - 1}
$$

$$
\frac{dx_2}{dx_1} = - \frac{a_1}{a_2} \cdot \frac{x_1^{\rho - 1}}{x_2^{\rho - 1}} = - \frac{a_1}{a_2} \left( \frac{x_1}{x_2} \right)^{\rho - 1}
$$


The TRS for the CES production function is:
$$ \text{TRS} = -\frac{ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} }{ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} } = -\frac{ a_1 x_1^{\rho-1} }{ a_2 x_2^{\rho-1} } $$

Simplifying:
$$ \text{TRS} = -\frac{a_1}{a_2} \cdot \left( \frac{x_1}{x_2} \right)^{\rho-1} $$

---

#### 3. TRS for Perfect Substitutes
The production function for perfect substitutes is:
$$ y = a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 $$

In this case, the TRS is constant, as the inputs can be substituted at a constant rate. The partial derivatives are:
$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} = a_1 $$
$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} = a_2 $$

Thus, the TRS is:
$$ \text{TRS} = -\frac{a_1}{a_2} $$

This implies that the two inputs are **perfect substitutes** for each other at the rate $\frac{a_1}{a_2}$.

---

#### 4. TRS for Perfect Complements
For perfect complements, the production function is:
$$ y = \min \left( a_1 x_1, a_2 x_2 \right) $$

In this case, the function is **not differentiable**, as the inputs must be used in fixed proportions. Therefore, we cannot use calculus to find the TRS.

However, we can infer the TRS based on the behavior of the inputs:
- If $a_1 x_1 > a_2 x_2$, then TRS = $\infty$, meaning no substitution is possible.
- If $a_1 x_1 = a_2 x_2$, then TRS is undefined, as the inputs must be used in fixed proportions.
- If $a_1 x_1 < a_2 x_2$, then TRS = 0, indicating that only one input can be increased without increasing the other.

Thus, for perfect complements, the TRS is either 0, infinity, or undefined depending on the combination of inputs.

---

### Conclusion:
The Technical Rate of Substitution (TRS) captures the trade-off between inputs required to maintain the same level of output. Its derivation depends on the form of the production function, and its value can vary widely, from a simple ratio (as in Cobb-Douglas) to being undefined (as in perfect complements).

---
## Elasticity of Substitution

The **Technical Rate of Substitution (TRS)** measures the **slope** of the isoquant, while the **Elasticity of Substitution** measures the **curvature** of the isoquant.

---

### Definition:
The **Elasticity of Substitution** is defined as the percentage change in the ratio of factor inputs divided by the percentage change in the TRS, while keeping the output constant.

Mathematically, the Elasticity of Substitution ($\sigma$) is expressed as:
$$ \sigma = \frac{d(x_2 / x_1)/(x_2/x_1)}{d(\text{TRS}) / \text{TRS}} $$

Where:
- $d(x_2 / x_1)$ represents the change in the ratio of factor inputs.
- $d(\text{TRS})$ represents the change in the TRS (the slope of the isoquant).

---

### Intuitive Explanation:
The **Elasticity of Substitution** is a natural measure of the curvature of the isoquant. It captures how the ratio of factor inputs ($x_2 / x_1$) changes as the slope of the isoquant (TRS) changes.

- If a **small change in the slope** (TRS) leads to a **large change in the factor input ratio**, the isoquant is relatively **flat**, and the elasticity ($\sigma$) is **large**.
- Conversely, if the isoquant is **more curved**, the elasticity ($\sigma$) is **lower**, indicating that larger changes in TRS result in smaller changes in the input ratio.

Thus, $\sigma$ represents the sensitivity of the input mix to changes in the slope of the isoquant.
![Internet connection required to fetch image](https://github.com/muzammilafroz/micro_notes/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-09-20%20231323.png?raw=true)

The formula for $\sigma$ is:
$$ \sigma = \frac{\% \text{change in input mix (factor ratio)}}{\% \text{change in slope (TRS)}} $$

---

### Key Insights:
- The **more curved** the isoquant, the **lower** the elasticity of substitution ($\sigma$).
- For any production technology, as $\sigma \to \infty$, we approach the case of **perfect substitutability** between the factors of production.
- As $\sigma \to 0$, we approach the case of **no substitutability** between factors (e.g., perfect complements).

---

### Intuitive Interpretation of $\sigma$:
- If $\sigma$ is **very high**, even a small change in the TRS will lead to a **large change in the input ratio**. In this case, the factors must be **very good substitutes**.
- If $\sigma$ is **low**, large percentage changes in the TRS result in **minimal changes in the factor ratio**. This implies that the factors are needed in **fixed proportions** and are not easily substitutable.

---

### Elasticity of Substitution ($\sigma$) Formula:
The general formula for $\sigma$ is:
$$ \sigma = \frac{d \ln \left( \frac{x_2}{x_1} \right)}{d \ln (\text{TRS})} $$

This expression represents the ratio of the logarithmic change in the input mix ($x_2 / x_1$) to the logarithmic change in the TRS.

---

### Examples:

#### 1. Elasticity of Substitution for Cobb-Douglas Production Function:
For a Cobb-Douglas production function, the TRS is:
$$ \text{TRS} = \frac{-a}{1-a} \cdot \frac{x_2}{x_1} $$

Taking the logarithm of both sides:
$$ \ln(\text{TRS}) = -\ln\left(\frac{a}{1-a}\right) + \ln\left(\frac{x_2}{x_1}\right) $$

Thus, the elasticity of substitution ($\sigma$) is:
$$ \sigma = \frac{d \ln \left( \frac{x_2}{x_1} \right)}{d \ln (\text{TRS})} = 1 $$

This shows that for a Cobb-Douglas production function, the **elasticity of substitution** is **constant** and equal to 1, implying that the inputs are **substitutable** but not perfect substitutes.

---

#### 2. Elasticity of Substitution for CES Production Function:
$$
\text{TRS} = -\frac{a_1}{a_2} \cdot \left( \frac{x_1}{x_2} \right)^{\rho - 1}
$$

#### Take the Logarithm of the TRS

Now, take the natural logarithm of both sides of the TRS equation:

$$
\ln(\text{TRS}) = \ln\left(-\frac{a_1}{a_2} \cdot \left( \frac{x_1}{x_2} \right)^{\rho - 1}\right)
$$

Using logarithmic properties, split this into two parts:

$$
\ln(\text{TRS}) = \ln\left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right) + (\rho - 1) \ln\left(\frac{x_1}{x_2}\right)
$$

Since $( \ln(-\frac{a_1}{a_2}) = \ln\left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right) )$ (as the logarithm of a negative number isn't defined for real values, we'll handle it assuming it refers to magnitude):

$$
\ln(\text{TRS}) = \ln\left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right) + (\rho - 1) \ln\left(\frac{x_1}{x_2}\right)
$$

#### Define Elasticity of Substitution

Elasticity of substitution $( \sigma )$ is defined as the percentage change in the ratio of inputs divided by the percentage change in the TRS:

$$
\sigma = \frac{d \ln \left( \frac{x_2}{x_1} \right)}{d \ln(\text{TRS})}
$$

Using the equation for $( \ln(\text{TRS}) )$, differentiate both sides with respect to $( \ln\left( \frac{x_2}{x_1} \right) )$:

$$
\frac{d \ln(\text{TRS})}{d \ln\left( \frac{x_2}{x_1} \right)} = \rho - 1
$$

#### Solve for $( \sigma )$

Now, the elasticity of substitution $( \sigma )$ is the inverse of this derivative:

$$
\sigma = \frac{1}{1 - \rho}
$$

Thus, for the CES production function, the elasticity of substitution is:

$$
\sigma = \frac{1}{1 - \rho}
$$

The parameter $\rho$ determines the **degree of substitutability** between the inputs. As $\rho \to 1$, the elasticity of substitution approaches infinity, indicating perfect substitutes. As $\rho \to -\infty$, the elasticity approaches zero, indicating perfect complements.

---

### Conclusion:
The **Elasticity of Substitution** is a crucial concept in understanding how easily inputs in a production function can be substituted for one another. It provides a deeper insight into the curvature of the isoquant, complementing the TRS, which only measures the slope.
For example:
- A **Cobb-Douglas production function** has a **constant elasticity** of substitution equal to 1.
- A **CES production function** can have a varying elasticity, depending on the value of the parameter $\rho$.

Please refer to the **CES production function** example on page 19 (Figure 1.8) in the Textbook for a graphical representation of this concept.

---
## Returns to Scale

The concept of **Returns to Scale** (RTS) refers to how the output of a production process changes when all inputs are **scaled up or down** by the same proportion. There are three main types of returns to scale:

---

### 1. Constant Returns to Scale (CRS):
A technology exhibits **Constant Returns to Scale (CRS)** if, when all inputs are multiplied by a scalar factor \( t \), the output is also multiplied by \( t \). Mathematically, a production function $(f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) )$ exhibits CRS if either of the following conditions is satisfied:

1. $f(tx) = t f(x)$ for all \( t > 0 \), where \( x \) represents the vector of input quantities.
2. The production function is **homogeneous of degree 1**, meaning that scaling inputs by a factor \( t \) scales the output by the same factor.

**But is CRS always a reasonable assumption?**

- Not always. It may be possible to scale **up** production processes, but **scaling down** is often not trivial. Scaling down could result in hitting the **minimum scale of production**, beyond which further reduction may not be economically viable.
  
  - For example, scaling up by integer multiples is possible, but scaling down may hit a limit, where production becomes inefficient.

- Also, while scaling up, it’s possible to encounter **increasing efficiencies** in certain production processes. For example, doubling all inputs might lead to **more than double the output**.

---

#### Example: Oil Pipeline
Consider a firm building an **oil pipeline** between two points, say A and B. If we double all inputs (such as materials, labor, etc.), the output (oil transported) might more than double. This happens because:
- The **surface area** of the pipeline increases by a factor of 2.
- But the **volume** of oil transported increases by a factor of 4, indicating **Increasing Returns to Scale** (IRS).

---

### 2. Increasing Returns to Scale (IRS):
A production function exhibits **Increasing Returns to Scale (IRS)** if, when all inputs are multiplied by a scalar \( t > 1 \), the output increases by more than \( t \). Mathematically:
$$ f(tx) > t f(x) \quad \text{for all} \quad t > 1 $$

**Example:** The pipeline scenario discussed above is an example of IRS, where doubling the inputs leads to more than double the output.

Another way CRS might be violated is when certain inputs cannot be **replicated**, like **agricultural land** or specific **natural resources**, leading to **IRS**.

---

### 3. Decreasing Returns to Scale (DRS):
A production function exhibits **Decreasing Returns to Scale (DRS)** if, when all inputs are multiplied by a scalar \( t > 1 \), the output increases by **less than** \( t \). Mathematically:
$$ f(tx) < t f(x) \quad \text{for all} \quad t > 1 $$

**DRS typically arises** when certain inputs are not easily replicable, such as **specialized labor** or **land**, leading to restricted production possibilities.

---

### Proving Decreasing Returns to Scale:
Suppose we have a **constant returns to scale** (CRS) production function but face constraints due to **fixed inputs**. We can represent this by introducing a **mythical input** \( z \) and redefine the production function.

Let’s define a new production function \( F(x, z) \) such that:
$$ F(x, z) = z f \left( \frac{x}{z} \right) $$

This new function \( F(x, z) \) exhibits CRS. Mathematically, it holds that:
$$ F(tx, tz) = tz f \left( \frac{tx}{tz} \right) = t z f \left( \frac{x}{z} \right) = t F(x, z) $$

Hence, the **original DRS function** \( f(x) \) can be seen as a **restricted CRS function** \( F(x, z) \) when \( z = 1 \).

---

### Examples of Returns to Scale:

#### 1. CES Production Function:
Consider a **CES production function**:
$$ f(x_1, x_2) = \left( a_1 x_1^\rho + a_2 x_2^\rho \right)^{\frac{1}{\rho}} $$

For this function, the output when inputs are scaled by \( t \) is:
$$ f(t x_1, t x_2) = \left( a_1 (t x_1)^\rho + a_2 (t x_2)^\rho \right)^{\frac{1}{\rho}} = t \left( a_1 x_1^\rho + a_2 x_2^\rho \right)^{\frac{1}{\rho}} = t f(x_1, x_2) $$

Thus, this production function exhibits **Constant Returns to Scale** (CRS).

#### 2. Decreasing Returns to Scale:
A simple production function like:
$$ f(x_1, x_2) = x_1^\alpha + x_2^\beta \quad \text{where} \quad \alpha + \beta < 1 $$

When inputs are scaled by \( t \), we get:
$$ f(t x_1, t x_2) = (t x_1)^\alpha + (t x_2)^\beta = t^\alpha x_1^\alpha + t^\beta x_2^\beta $$

Since $\alpha + \beta < 1$, the function exhibits **Decreasing Returns to Scale (DRS)** because:
$$ f(t x_1, t x_2) < t f(x_1, x_2) $$

#### 3. Isoquant Shapes for Returns to Scale:
The shape of isoquants also provides insight into the type of returns to scale. For example:
- **IRS Isoquant**: Isoquants are more spaced out as output increases, reflecting increasing efficiency as inputs scale up.
- **DRS Isoquant**: Isoquants become closer as output increases, reflecting diminishing returns as inputs scale up.
- **CRS Isoquant**: Isoquants maintain consistent spacing, indicating constant returns as inputs scale.
![Internet connection is required to fetch the image](https://github.com/muzammilafroz/micro_notes/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-09-23%20041358.png?raw=true)

These characteristics illustrate how the shape of isoquants changes based on the type of returns to scale exhibited by the production function.

---
#### ELASTICITY OF SCALE

Elasticity of scale measures the percentage increase in output due to a one percent increase in all inputs, i.e., due to an increase in the scale of operations. Let’s begin by defining the production function.

Given a production function $y = f(x)$, let $t$ be a positive scalar used to represent a scaling factor for all inputs. We are interested in how the output $y(t)$ changes when all inputs are scaled by a factor of $t$. 

Let $y(t) = f(tx)$, where $( tx )$ represents the scaled inputs.

#### Scale of Operations:

- When $t = 1$, it represents the current scale of operations.
- When $t > 1$, it represents scaling up all inputs by a factor of $t$.
- When $t < 1$, it represents scaling down all inputs by a factor of $t$.

The elasticity of scale, denoted as $e(x)$, is defined as:

$$
e(x) = \left( \frac{d y(t)}{d t} \cdot \frac{t}{y(t)} \right) \bigg|_{t=1}
$$

This expression helps us analyze how the production technology behaves as we scale inputs. Specifically:

- If $e(x) = 1$, the technology exhibits constant returns to scale (CRS).
- If $e(x) < 1$, the technology exhibits decreasing returns to scale (DRS).
- If $e(x) > 1$, the technology exhibits increasing returns to scale (IRS).

#### Example:

Let’s consider an example production function:

$$
y(t) = (a_1 x_1^\rho + a_2 x_2^\rho)^{\frac{1}{\rho}}
$$

Now, we calculate the derivative of $y(t)$ with respect to $t$ to determine the elasticity of scale. Taking the derivative:

$$
\frac{d y(t)}{d t} = \left( \frac{d}{d t} \left( (a_1 x_1^\rho + a_2 x_2^\rho)^{\frac{1}{\rho}} \right) \right)
$$

Evaluating this at $t = 1$:

$$
e(x) = \left( \frac{d}{d t} \left( (a_1 x_1^\rho + a_2 x_2^\rho)^{\frac{1}{\rho}} \right) \cdot \frac{t}{(a_1 x_1^\rho + a_2 x_2^\rho)^{\frac{1}{\rho}}} \right) \bigg|_{t=1}
$$

Thus, if $(a_1 + a_2) = 1$, we have CRS. If $(a_1 + a_2) < 1$, we have DRS, and if $(a_1 + a_2) > 1$, we have IRS.

#### Elasticity of Scale for a Single Input:

Elasticity of scale for a single input is the ratio of marginal product (MP) to average product (AP). We will now prove this.

We begin by defining the elasticity of scale, $e(x)$, as:

$$
e(x) = \frac{d f(tx)}{d t} \cdot \frac{t}{f(tx)} \bigg|_{t=1}
$$

This represents how output changes in response to a uniform scaling of all inputs by $t$. The expression can be rewritten as:

$$
e(x) = \frac{\frac{d f(tx)}{d t} \cdot t}{f(tx)} \bigg|_{t=1}
$$

Next, we differentiate the function $f(tx)$ with respect to $t$:

$$
\frac{d f(tx)}{d t} = \frac{\partial f(tx)}{\partial (tx)} \cdot \frac{\partial (tx)}{\partial t}
$$

Substitute this into the elasticity expression:

$$
e(x) = \frac{\frac{\partial f(tx)}{\partial (tx)} \cdot \frac{\partial (tx)}{\partial t} \cdot t}{f(tx)} \bigg|_{t=1}
$$

Since $\frac{\partial (tx)}{\partial t} = x$, the expression becomes:

$$
e(x) = \frac{\frac{\partial f(tx)}{\partial (tx)} \cdot x \cdot t}{f(tx)} \bigg|_{t=1}
$$

Evaluating this at $t = 1$, we get:

$$
e(x) = \frac{\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x} \cdot x}{f(x)}
$$

This expression represents the ratio of marginal product $( MP_x )$ to average product $( AP_x )$. Thus, we can conclude:

$$
e(x) = \frac{MP_x}{AP_x}
$$

Hence, the elasticity of scale for a single input is the ratio of the marginal product to the average product.

---
### HOMOGENEOUS AND HOMOTHETIC TECHNOLOGIES

A function $f(x)$ is homogeneous of degree $k$ if:

$$
f(tx) = t^k \cdot f(x) \quad \text{for all} \, t > 0
$$

This property describes how a production function responds to proportional changes in all inputs. There are two important special cases of homogeneity:

- Homogeneous of degree 0: 
$$
f(tx) = f(x)
$$ 
This indicates that the output remains unchanged when all inputs are scaled by a factor $t$.
  
- Homogeneous of degree 1: 
$$
f(tx) = t \cdot f(x)
$$ 
This represents **constant returns to scale (CRS)**, meaning if all inputs are scaled by a factor $t$, the output is scaled by the same factor. Thus, CRS technology is only valid for production functions that are homogeneous of degree 1.

---

### Homothetic Functions

A **homothetic function** is defined as a monotonic transformation of a function that is homogeneous of degree 1. 

#### Definition:

Let $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a strictly increasing function, which is called a **positive monotonic transformation**. That is, if $x > y$, then $g(x) > g(y)$.

A function $f(x)$ is **homothetic** if there exists a homogeneous function $h(x)$ of degree 1, such that:

$$
f(x) = g(h(x))
$$

In this case, $g(.)$ is a monotonic transformation. For example, let $h(x)$ be homogeneous of degree 1. Then $f(x)$ is homothetic if and only if $g(.)$ is monotonic.

#### Example:

Suppose $h(x) = 2y$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are inputs. Then, for a homothetic function:

$$
f(x) = g(2y)
$$

This means the output $f(x)$ is a transformed version of a homogeneous function of degree 1.

### Why Study Homogeneous and Homothetic Functions?

1. **Homogeneous Functions**: 
   - Many well-behaved production functions in economics are homogeneous of degree 1, which is directly related to CRS technology.
   - Homogeneous functions of degree 1 imply that output scales proportionally with inputs, which is a crucial assumption in many economic models.

2. **Homothetic Functions**: 
   - Homothetic functions allow for flexibility because they include a monotonic transformation of a CRS technology. 
   - These transformations enable us to measure output in different units (e.g., converting kilograms to pounds) without altering the fundamental relationship between inputs and outputs.

For instance, changing from kilograms to pounds is a simple monotonic transformation. However, if we apply a more complex transformation, such as squaring or taking the square root of the output, the output may change non-linearly.

In the figures, we can describe the behavior of isoquants for homogeneous and homothetic functions as follows:

- **Homogeneous Isoquants**: 
  - If the production function is homogeneous, doubling the inputs results in output **doubling**. This implies **constant returns to scale (CRS)** when the function is homogeneous of degree 1.
  - Hence, **homogeneous isoquants** represent a situation where scaling up all inputs by the same factor leads to an **exact doubling of output**.

- **Homothetic Isoquants**: 
  - If the production function is homothetic, increasing the inputs does lead to an increase in output, but the change is **not necessarily proportional**. 
  - Homothetic isoquants, therefore, show that output has increased, but the magnitude of the increase is **ambiguous** and depends on the specific monotonic transformation applied.

#### Formalization

Let us now formalize the differences between homogeneous and homothetic functions:

#### Homogeneous Function

If $f(x)$ is homogeneous of degree $k$, then for any scalar $t > 0$:

$$
f(tx) = t^k \cdot f(x)
$$

This means that scaling the inputs $x$ by $t$ will result in the output scaling by $t^k$. For example, if $k = 1$, this implies constant returns to scale (CRS), where:

$$
f(tx) = t \cdot f(x)
$$

In particular, if we take two different input levels $tx$ and $tx'$, then the output scales accordingly:

$$
f(tx) = ty \quad \text{and} \quad f(tx') = ty'
$$

where $y$ and $y'$ are the output levels corresponding to the inputs $x$ and $x'$, respectively. In this case, output scales by the same factor as the inputs.

#### Homothetic Function

If $g(x)$ is homothetic, then increasing the inputs $x$ by a factor $t$ and $t'$ leads to an **increase in output**. However, unlike in the case of homogeneous functions, the output **does not necessarily scale proportionally** with the inputs.

This means:

$$
g(tx) \quad \text{and} \quad g(tx')
$$

lead to an increase in output, but the increase is **not exactly proportional** to the increase in inputs as it would be for a homogeneous function. This distinction arises because a homothetic function involves a monotonic transformation of a homogeneous function of degree 1.


Thus, a homothetic function provides a way to measure output so that it behaves like a CRS function.

---

### Elasticity of Scale and TRS

Both homogeneous and homothetic functions have the property that the **technical rate of substitution (TRS)** is independent of the scale of production. This is a crucial property for analyzing how inputs can be substituted for one another without affecting the output level.

#### Proof:

Consider a function that is homogeneous of degree $k$. By definition, we have:

$$
f(tx_1, tx_2, \dots, tx_n) = t^k \cdot f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)
$$

Differentiating both sides with respect to $t$, we get:

$$
\frac{\partial f(tx)}{\partial t} = t^k \cdot \frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x}
$$

Since the partial derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x_i$ is homogeneous of degree $k-1$, we have:

$$
\frac{\partial f(tx)}{\partial x_i} = t^{k-1} \cdot \frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_i}
$$

It follows that for a homogeneous function of degree $k$, its partial derivative is homogeneous of degree $k-1$. 

Thus, the **TRS**, which is the ratio of partial derivatives, is homogeneous of degree 0. In other words, the TRS is independent of the scale of production, as it depends only on the ratio of inputs, not their absolute levels.

---

### Summary:

- Homogeneous functions describe production processes that scale proportionally with inputs.
- Homothetic functions generalize this idea by allowing for a monotonic transformation of a CRS function, enabling flexibility in measuring output.
- Both functions have a TRS that is independent of scale, which simplifies the analysis of input substitution in production.

# Chapter 2 - Microeconomics (Profit Maximization)

### What is Profit?
In economics, profit is defined as the difference between the revenue a firm receives and the costs it incurs during the production of goods and services.

We have already learned that economic cost is different from the cost as defined in accountancy. In accountancy, cost represents anything the business has explicitly paid for, and we can calculate accounting costs by simply examining the company's balance sheet. However, economic costs represent a "what if" scenario for your business. These costs include both explicit costs (like those in accountancy) and implicit costs.

Implicit costs refer to those costs that are not recorded in the ledger but represent the opportunity cost of using resources. For instance, if a person owns a business, they forego the salary they could have earned working elsewhere. This foregone salary is considered an implicit cost of running the current business.

### Profit, Revenue, and Cost Functions
Now, both the revenue and costs of a firm depend on the decisions or actions taken by the firm. These actions can include production activities, purchasing inputs, advertising expenses, innovation efforts, etc.

Suppose we write these actions as $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

**Revenue function:**
$$
R(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)
$$

**Cost function:**
$$
C(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)
$$

A fundamental assumption in economic analysis is that a firm acts to maximize its profits. We can express the profit maximization condition as:

$$
\pi = \max \left( R(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) - C(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) \right)
$$

### Basic Principles of Profit Maximization
Even at this broad level of generality, two fundamental principles of profit maximization emerge.

A simple application of calculus shows that the optimal set of conditions for profit maximization can be written as follows:

**First-order condition for maximization:**
$$
\frac{\partial R(a^*)}{\partial a_i} - \frac{\partial C(a^*)}{\partial a_i} = 0 \quad \text{for } i = 1, \ldots, n
$$

This implies:
$$
\frac{\partial R(a^*)}{\partial a_i} = \frac{\partial C(a^*)}{\partial a_i} \quad \text{for } i = 1, \ldots, n
$$

### Interpretation
This condition suggests that profit is maximized when the marginal revenue (MR) from an additional unit of $a_i$ equals the marginal cost (MC). The intuition behind this is:

- If $MR > MC$, the firm should keep increasing $a_i$ to increase profits.
- If $MR < MC$, the firm should decrease $a_i$ to prevent a loss in profits.
- If $MR = MC$, the firm is at the optimal point where profits are maximized, and any further change in $a_i$ will not improve profits.

Thus, marginal revenue equals marginal cost is the key condition for profit maximization.

### Applications of the First Condition
This fundamental condition can be applied in several ways:

- The firm can decide the quantity of output to produce using this condition.
- The firm can also determine the amount of labor to hire based on this condition.

### Second Fundamental Condition of Profit Maximization

The second fundamental condition is the condition of long-run profits. If two firms have identical revenue and cost functions, then in the long run, they cannot have equal profits. Why? Because the firm earning lower profit can imitate the actions of the other firm and claim the same amount of profit.

To apply these conditions in a more structured manner, let us examine the revenue and cost components more carefully.

### Revenue and Costs
- **Revenue**: This is how much a firm sells, determined by the price of each unit sold.
- **Costs**: This is how much a firm incurs, determined by the price of each unit of input used.

When the firm is maximizing its profit, at a more fundamental level, it is:

1. Choosing what prices to charge for its output.
2. Deciding what levels of output and inputs it wishes to use and pay for.

Of course, it cannot set prices unilaterally.

### Constraints in Determining Optimal Policy
While determining its optimal policy, the firm faces two kinds of constraints:

- **Technological constraints**: These are constraints that concern the feasibility of the production plan.
- **Market constraints**: These concern the effect of the actions of other agents on the firm, such as consumers, suppliers, and other firms.

When the firm decides on its optimal policy, it must take into account both of these constraints.

We will assume the simplest kind of market constraints—each firm takes the price of goods as given. Thus, the firm will choose the amount of output and inputs. We will study the optimal choice of production plans for the firm in a competitive environment.

---
## Profit Maximization

We are trying to analyze a firm's actions when the prices of output and inputs are given. Let \( P \) be a vector of prices for inputs and outputs of the firm—a row vector of prices with the first value being the price of the output good.

### Profit Maximization Problem
The profit maximization problem can be expressed as:

$$
\pi(P) = \max py \quad \text{s.t. } y \in Y
$$

Where:

$$
\pi(P) = Pq - wL - rk
$$

The function $\pi(P)$ represents the maximum profit as a function of the quantities, and this is called the profit function of the firm.

### Restricted Profit Function
If we are considering a short-run maximization problem, a restricted profit function will be:

$$
\pi^*(P, z) = \max py \quad \text{s.t. } y \in Y(z)
$$

If the firm produces a single good, then:

$$
\pi^T(P, w) = p f(x)
$$

Where \( w \) is a column vector of non-negative input quantities and \( x \) is a vector of input prices.

### Cost Function
The cost function can be expressed as:

$$
C(w, y) = \min wx \quad \text{s.t. } x \in V(y)
$$

We can think of it as a form of restricted profit function since it applies to a particular level of output.

### Restricted Cost Function
The restricted cost function is given by:

$$
C(w, y, z) = \min wx \quad \text{s.t. } (y, - x) \in Y(z)
$$

The cost function gives the minimum cost of producing a level of output \( y \) when input prices are \( w \).

**Note**: We do not consider the price of output as given in this formulation, so the firm is a price taker only in the input market, which is useful for monopoly markets.

### First-Order Conditions (F.O.C)
For a single output, we have:

$$
\pi^T(P, w) = Pf(x) - wx
$$

The first-order condition is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial \pi^T(P, W)}{\partial x} = P \partial f(x^*)/\partial x_i  - w_i = 0 \quad \text{for } i = 1, \ldots, n
$$

This implies:

$$
P D f(x^*) = W
$$

### Value of Marginal Product
In vector notation:

$$
P D f(x^*) = W
$$

$$D f(x^*) = \left( \frac{\partial f(x^*)}{\partial x_1}, \ldots, \frac{\partial f(x^*)}{\partial x_n} \right)$$

$$W = (w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n)$$

**"Value of marginal product equals price"**

- The first fundamental condition of profit maximizing action


### Graphical Representation of F.O.C
Let the production possibility set be given by \( Y \). Since we are producing a single output, it can be presented as:
![Connect to internet to fetch image](https://github.com/muzammilafroz/micro_notes/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-09-23%20052757.png?raw=true)

In this 2D case, profit can be expressed as:

$$
\pi = py - wx
$$

The isoprofit line in the $(y, x)$ plane is a straight upward-sloping line with an intercept of $\frac{\pi}{p}$ and a slope of $\frac{W}{p}$.
![Connect to internet to fetch image](https://github.com/muzammilafroz/micro_notes/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-09-23%20053251.png?raw=true)

### Second-Order Conditions for Profit Maximization
A profit-maximizing firm wants to find a point on the production set with the maximum level of profits. 

To ensure local concavity, the second derivative conditions must be satisfied:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 f(x^*)}{\partial x^2} \leq 0
$$

For a multiple input case, the matrix of the second derivatives of the production function must be negative semi-definite:

$$
D^2 f(x^*) = \left(\frac{\partial^2 f(x^*)}{\partial x_i{\partial x_i}}\right)
$$

For $A$ to be a semi-negative definite matrix, all principal minors $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_m$ must satisfy the following property: they alternate in signs beginning with a minus one. In other words, $|A_i| \leq 0$ for $i$ being odd and  $|A_i| \geq 0$ for $i$ being even.

---

## Profit Maximization Challenges

### Factor Demand Function
The factor demand function gives us the optimal choice of inputs as a function of prices $(P, w)$:

$$
x(P, w)
$$

### Supply Function
The supply function expresses output as a function of the optimal input:

$$
y(P, w) = f(x[P, w])
$$

We assume that both the factor demand function and the firm supply function are well-defined and behave nicely. However, it is worth considering problems that may arise if they do not.

### Issues with Technology
Technology may not be described by a differentiable production function, which affects the derivatives described above. For example, in the case of a Leontief production function, the calculus conditions derived above make sense only when the choice variables can be varied in an open neighborhood of the optimal choice. If some variables have a value of zero at the optimal choice, the calculus conditions may be inappropriate. 

The necessary modifications to handle boundary solutions are not difficult to state. For example, if we constrain \( x \) to be non-negative in the maximization problem, the relevant first-order conditions (F.O.C.) become:

$$\rho \frac{\partial k}{\partial x_i} - \omega_i \leq 0 \text{ if } x_i = 0$$

$$\rho \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} - \omega_i = 0 \text{ if } x_i > 0$$
*[Combined marginal profit from increasing $x_i$ must be non-positive]*


Thus, the marginal profit from increasing \( x \) must be non-positive, leading to the Kuhn-Tucker conditions (to be revisited later).

### No Profit-Maximizing Production Plan
There may exist cases where no profit-maximizing production plan is possible. For example, consider the production function:

$$
f(x) = x
$$

Then the profit function is:

$$
\pi = P \cdot f{x} - Wx
$$


The derivative of $\pi$ with respect to \( x \) is always positive, meaning profit is ever-increasing. Thus, there is no maximum profit point.

### Constant Returns to Scale (CRS)
If \( f(x) \) exhibits constant returns to scale (CRS), then:

$$
\pi = P \cdot f(x^*) - wx^*
$$
$$\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x} = p - w > 0$$


If we scale up production by a factor $t>1$ profit will be:

$$
P f(tx^*) - wtx^* = tx^* > x^*
$$

In this case, profits can be made larger, leading to unbounded profits and thus no maximal profit production plan will exist. 

#### Profit Maximization with CRS
What if  $Pf(x^*) - w \cdot x^* = 0?$ $\text{ with CRS?}$

If $\pi(P, w) = 0$ with CRS, and the firm is making a profit, then it is indifferent between all input choices. Therefore, the production plan may not be unique. If $f(tx)$ yields the same profit level for various inputs, profit maximization is not possible.

If a CRS firm is making a profit, it is indifferent between all other input choices.


#### Formalizing the Profit Maximization Problem
Let us formalize the maximization problem using a single output:

$$
\pi = Pf(x) - wx
$$

The first-order condition (F.O.C.) is:

$$
P f'(x) - w = 0
$$

### Second-Order Conditions (S.O.C.)
The second-order condition for profit maximization is:

$$
\frac{1}{P\cdot f'' (x(P,w))} \leq 0 
$$

### Example: Profit Maximization for Cobb-Douglas Technology
Consider a Cobb-Douglas production function:

$$
f(x) = x^a \quad \text{where } a > 0
$$

The first-order condition becomes:

$$
P a x^{a-1} - w = 0
$$

The second-order condition is:

$$
P a (a - 1) x^{a-2} \leq 0
$$

For the second-order condition to be satisfied, we require $\leq 1$.

### Implications of Cobb-Douglas Technology
1. If \( a < 1 \): The firm has a unique profit-maximizing production plan.
2. If \( a = 1 \): Profit maximization is achievable, and the F.O.C. does not depend on \( a \).
3. If \( a > 1 \): The firm does not have a unique profit-maximizing production plan.

### Deriving Factor Demand and Supply Functions
For \( a < 1 \), we can derive the factor demand function and the firm supply function using the first-order condition:

$$
P a x^{a-1} = w
$$

Thus, the factor demand function tells us how much input the firm will demand as a function of its own price, given other parameters:

$$
Y(P, w) = f(x(P, w)) = \frac{w}{a\cdot p}^\frac{a}{a-1}
$$

The firm supply function gives us information on the amount of output that the firm will be willing to produce as a function of the price of the output.

Finally, the profit function is given by:

$$
\pi(P, W) = P \cdot y(P, w) - w \cdot x(P, w)
$$
$$=w\frac{1-a}{a}\cdot \frac{w}{a\cdot p}^\frac{a}{a-1}$$

---
## Properties of the Demand and Supply Function

- **Factor demand function**: The factor demand function refers to the **optimal choice of input** as a function of prices.
  
- **Firm supply function**: The firm supply function refers to the **optimal choice of output** as a function of prices.

#### How do we get these functions from the profit maximization solution?

These functions are derived from the **profit maximization problem**, which implies certain restrictions on the behavior of the demand and supply functions.

If we multiply all of the prices by some positive number $t$, the vector of factor input that maximizes profit $\pi$ will not change.

#### Proof:

The profit function is defined as:

$$
\pi = P \cdot f(x) - w \cdot x
$$

where $P$ is the output price, $f(x)$ is the production function, $w$ is the input price, and $x$ is the quantity of input.

The **first-order condition (F.O.C.)** for profit maximization is given by:

$$
P \cdot f'(x) = w
$$

Now, consider multiplying all prices by a positive scalar $t$:

$$
\pi = tP \cdot f(x) - tw \cdot x
$$

The F.O.C. remains the same:

$$
tP \cdot f'(x) = tw
$$

Simplifying:

$$
P \cdot f'(x) = w
$$

This shows that the **optimal input choice** $x_i(P, w)$ is unaffected by scaling prices. Thus, we conclude:

$$
x_i(tP, tw) = x_i(P, w)
$$

This proves that **factor demand functions are homogeneous of degree zero**.

#### Implications:

This property is important because it provides a way to verify if an observed production plan is generated by a firm maximizing profits. Specifically, **factor demand functions should be homogeneous of degree zero**.

### Practical Uses of This Property:

1. **Theoretical Examination**: 
   - We can use this property to make theoretical statements about how a profit-maximizing firm would respond to changes in its economic environment (e.g., changes in prices).

2. **Empirical Validation**: 
   - We can empirically test if a firm's observed demand functions exhibit patterns consistent with profit maximization. For example, if prices double but the firm’s demand and supplies change, the firm is **not** a profit maximizer.

#### Example:

If a firm's demand and supplies change when prices double without any other change, the firm is **not** a profit maximizer. This contradicts the property that demand functions should be homogeneous of degree zero.

---

### How Do We Derive These Properties?

There are three main methods:

1. **First-order conditions (F.O.C.):**
   - By examining the F.O.C. that characterize the firm's optimal choices.
  
2. **Direct Examination of the Demand and Supply Functions:**
   - By examining the maximizing properties of demand and supply functions directly.

3. **Properties of the Profit and Cost Functions:**
   - By analyzing how profit and cost functions respond to changes in prices and other factors.

---

## Comparative Static Analysis:

Comparative static analysis involves examining how optimal choices respond to changes in the economic environment. In particular, we are interested in the **sensitivity** of optimal choices to changes in one of the **parameters** of the model.

#### What is Comparative Static Analysis?

Comparative static analysis helps us understand how a firm's optimal decisions (e.g., input choices, output levels) change in response to **exogenous shocks** to the model, such as changes in prices or technology.

---

### Comparative Statics Using F.O.Cs

Let's consider a firm that maximizes its profits with one output and one input. The profit maximization problem is formulated as follows:

$$
\pi = P f(x) - wx
$$

where $P$ is the output price, $f(x)$ is the production function, and $w$ is the input price. 

#### F.O.C. (First-Order Condition) of Profit Maximization:

The first-order condition (F.O.C.) for profit maximization is given by:

$$
P f'(x(P, w)) - w = 0
$$

Here, $x(P, w)$ represents the equilibrium choice of the input $x$ as a function of prices $P$ and $w$. Therefore, $x(P, w)$ is the **factor demand function**.

#### S.O.C. (Second-Order Condition):

The second-order condition (S.O.C.) ensures that the firm’s profit is maximized:

$$
P f''(x(P, w)) \leq 0
$$

This confirms that the profit function is concave, ensuring that the solution is a maximum.

---

### Comparative Static Analysis:

Suppose we want to examine how $x(P, w)$ changes when the input price $w$ changes. This is where **comparative static analysis** comes into play.

We start by differentiating the F.O.C. with respect to $w$:

$$
P f'(x(P, w)) - w = 0
$$

Differentiating both sides with respect to $w$:

$$
P f''(x(P, w)) \frac{dx(P, w)}{dw} - 1 = 0
$$

Rearranging this expression:

$$
\frac{dx(P, w)}{dw} = \frac{1}{P f''(x(P, w))}
$$

Since $f''(x) \leq 0$ from the second-order condition, the sign of $\frac{dx(P, w)}{dw}$ is negative. Thus, an **increase in the price of the input** reduces its **demand**, as expected.

This method gives us an explicit expression for how the demand for the input changes with respect to changes in its price, $\frac{dx}{dw}$.

---

### Comparative Static Analysis for Two Inputs:

Now, let’s extend the analysis to a case where the firm has **one output and two inputs** ($x_1$ and $x_2$). For simplicity, we assume the price of the output, $P = 1$. The profit maximization problem becomes:

$$
\pi = f(x_1, x_2) - w_1 x_1 - w_2 x_2
$$

#### F.O.C. (First-Order Conditions) for Two Inputs:

The first-order conditions for maximizing profits with respect to $x_1$ and $x_2$ are:

$$
\frac{\partial f(x_1, x_2)}{\partial x_1} = w_1
$$

$$
\frac{\partial f(x_1, x_2)}{\partial x_2} = w_2
$$

These conditions give the optimal values of $x_1(w_1, w_2)$ and $x_2(w_1, w_2)$ that satisfy the profit-maximizing conditions.

---
The optimal values of $x_1$ and $x_2$ $\rightarrow$ $x_1(w_1, w_2)$ and $x_2(w_1, w_2)$ will always satisfy these F.O.C.s:

$$
\frac{\partial f(x_1(w_1, w_2), x_2(w_1, w_2))}{\partial x_1} = w_1
$$

$$
\frac{\partial f(x_1(w_1, w_2), x_2(w_1, w_2))}{\partial x_2} = w_2
$$


### Comparative Statics for Two Inputs:

To see how the inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$ change with respect to changes in input prices, we differentiate the F.O.C.s with respect to $w_1$. The differentiation of the first F.O.C. with respect to $w_1$ yields:

$$
f_{11}(x_1, x_2) \frac{dx_1}{dw_1} + f_{12}(x_1, x_2) \frac{dx_2}{dw_1} = 1
$$

For the second F.O.C., differentiation with respect to $w_1$ gives:

$$
f_{21}(x_1, x_2) \frac{dx_1}{dw_1} + f_{22}(x_1, x_2) \frac{dx_2}{dw_1} = 0
$$

Simply:

$$
f_{11} \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial w_1} + f_{12} \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial w_1} = 1
$$

$$
f_{21} \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial w_1} + f_{22} \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial w_1} = 0
$$

Thus:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
f_{11} & f_{12} \\
f_{21} & f_{22}
\end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial x_1}{\partial w_1} \\
\frac{\partial x_2}{\partial w_1}
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Using Cramer's rule:

$$
\frac{\partial x_1}{\partial w_1} =
\frac{
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & f_{12} \\
0 & f_{22}
\end{pmatrix}
}{
\begin{pmatrix}
f_{11} & f_{12} \\
f_{21} & f_{22}
\end{pmatrix}
}
$$

This is the comparative statics of $x_1$ w.r.t. $w_1$, in a two-input framework.

You can also get an expression for $\frac{\partial x_2}{\partial w_1}$ using Cramer's rule.

**Comparative Static Analysis (C.S.A)** with respect to $W_1$:

We are interested in the comparative static analysis (C.S.A.) with respect to $W_1$:

$$
f_{11} \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial W_1} + f_{12} \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial W_1} = 0
$$
$$
f_{21} \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial W_1} + f_{22} \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial W_1} = 1
$$

We can also integrate the C.S.A. with respect to $W_1$ and $W_2$ as follows:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
    f_{11} & f_{12} \\
    f_{21} & f_{22}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
    \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial W_1}  & \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial W_2} \\
    \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial W_1} & \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial W_2}
\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}
    1 &0 \\
    0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

We now proceed to integrate C.S.A. with respect to both $W_1$ and $W_2$. The substitution matrix $S$ describes how the firm substitutes one input for another as factor prices change:

$$
S = \begin{pmatrix}
    \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial W_1} & \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial W_2} \\
    \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial W_1} & \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial W_2}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The **substitution matrix** is the inverse of the Hessian matrix $H$:

$$
H = \begin{pmatrix}
    f_{11} & f_{12} \\
    f_{21} & f_{22}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### Important Implications:
- The Hessian matrix is a **symmetric negative definite matrix** by **Young's theorem**. Therefore, the substitution matrix must also be symmetric and negative definite.

Hence:
1. $\frac{\partial x_1}{\partial W_1}$ and $\frac{\partial x_2}{\partial W_2}$ are negative (from the diagonal elements).
2. $\frac{\partial x_1}{\partial W_2} = \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial W_1}$ (from symmetry).

Generalizing to $n$ inputs and $p = 1$:

$$
D f(x(W)) = W
$$
Differentiating with respect to $W$:

$$
D^2 f(x(W)) \cdot D x(W) = I
$$

Thus:

$$
D x(W) = \left[ D^2 f(x(W)) \right]^{-1}
$$

---

### Comparative Statics using Algebra - Weak Axiom of Profit Maximization (WAPM)

Suppose we have some empirical data:
1. Data on observed price vectors $p_t$, for $t = 1, 2, \dots, T$
2. Data on associated net output vectors $y(p_t)$ for $t = 1, 2, \dots, T$

In the net supply format, this can be written as:

$$
(p_t, y(p_t)) \quad \text{for} \quad t = 1, 2, \dots, T
$$

The first question is: **What does profit maximization imply about this data?**

If the firm is maximizing profits, the observed net output choice at price $p_t$ must have a profit level **at least as great** as the profit from any other net output the firm could have chosen.
Well, we do not have information on all other feasible choices in this situation, but we know some of them $y_s$ for $s = 1...T$ (choices chosen in other situations)

A **necessary condition** for profit maximization is:

$$
p_t \cdot y_t \geq p_t \cdot y_s \quad \text{for all} \quad t \quad \text{and} \quad s = 1, 2, \dots, T
$$

This is known as the **Weak Axiom of Profit Maximization (WAPM)**.

Let us depict this graphically:

**Revisiting the Isoprofit Line in Profit Maximization**
We will represent this graphically, showing both **output** and **input** decisions.

Here, the firm selects $y_2$ at price $P_2$, and $P_2 y_2 < P_1 y_1$ satisfies WAPM.

$$
\text{Hint: Isoprofit lines are associated with specific price levels.}
$$

Using $y = \frac{(\Pi + w)}{p} x$, we can examine the slope and intercept of these isoprofit lines. **WAPM** is a simple but very useful condition in profit maximization.

---

### Consequences of WAPM

Suppose we take two observations, $t$ and $s$:

1. $p_t y_t \geq p_t y_s \implies p_t (y_t - y_s) \geq 0$
2. Similarly, $-p_s (y_t - y_s) \geq 0$

Adding these two inequalities, we get:

$$
(p_t - p_s) \cdot (y_t - y_s) \geq 0
$$

This means the **inner product** of the vector of price changes with the associated vector of changes in net outputs must be non-negative:

$$
\Delta p \cdot \Delta y \geq 0
$$

For example, suppose $\Delta p = (1, 0, \dots, 0)$, which indicates that the price of the **first good** has increased. This implies that $\Delta y_1 \geq 0$:

- If the **first good** is an **output good**, $\Delta y_1 \geq 0$, meaning the firm **increases supply** of the good due to a rise in its own price.
- If the **first good** is an **input good**, $\Delta y_1 \leq 0$, meaning the **demand** for the factor **decreases** as its price rises.

This graphical and algebraic depiction explains the consequences of WAPM and how price and output adjustments are linked.

# Chapter 3 - Profit function (Microeconomics)

## Objective:

Given any production set  $Y$, we want to:

1.  Calculate the maximum profit—obtain an expression.
2.  Determine the factor demand functions $x(p)$.
3.  Derive the firm's supply functions $y(p) = f(x(p))$.
4.  Obtain the profit function $\pi(p) = p \cdot y(p) - w \cdot x(p)$.

This profit function provides the maximum attainable profit at prices $p$. The profit function has several important properties that we will explore.

## Mathematical Perspective:

From a mathematical standpoint, the objective function in this problem is a linear function of prices:

$\pi(p) = \max_{y \in Y} p \cdot y$


## Properties of the Profit Function

These properties are derived solely from the assumption of profit maximization, without requiring assumptions about convexity, monotonicity, or other regularity conditions.

1.  **Non-decreasing in output prices, non-increasing in input prices:** 

    If $p_i' \ge p_i$ for all outputs and $p_j' \le p_j$ for all inputs, then $\pi(p') \ge \pi(p)$.

    **Proof:**

    *   Let $y$ be the profit-maximizing plan at $p$ and $y'$ be the profit-maximizing plan at $p'$.
    *   Then, $\pi(p) = p \cdot y$ and $\pi(p') = p' \cdot y'$.
    *   By the Weak Axiom of Profit Maximization (WAPM), since $p \cdot y \ge p \cdot y'$ and $p' \cdot y' \ge p' \cdot y$, and since $p_i' \ge p_i$ and $p_j' \le p_j$, we have $p' \cdot y' \ge p \cdot y$.
    *   Combining, we get $\pi(p') \ge \pi(p)$.

2.  **Homogeneous of degree 1 in $p$:** 

    $\pi(tp) = t\pi(p)$ for all $t \ge 0$.

    **Proof:**

    *   Let $y$ be a maximizing net output vector at $p$. 
    *   Then, $\pi(p) = p \cdot y \ge p \cdot y'$ for all $y' \in Y$.
    *   Multiplying both sides by $t$, we get $t \cdot p \cdot y \ge t \cdot p \cdot y'$.
    *   This implies $(tp) \cdot y \ge (tp) \cdot y'$. 
    *   Thus, $\pi(tp) = t \cdot p \cdot y = t \cdot \pi(p)$.

3.  **Convex in $p$:** 

    Let $p'' = tp + (1-t)p'$ for $0 \le t \le 1$. Then, $\pi(p'') \le t\pi(p) + (1-t)\pi(p')$.

    **Proof:**

    *   Let $y$ maximize profits at $p$, $y'$ maximize profits at $p'$, and $y''$ maximize profits at $p''$.
    *   Then, $\pi(p'') = p'' \cdot y'' = (tp + (1-t)p') \cdot y'' = t \cdot p \cdot y'' + (1-t)p' \cdot y''$.
    *   Now, $\pi(p) = p \cdot y \ge p \cdot y''$, which implies $t \cdot p \cdot y \ge t \cdot p \cdot y''$.
    *   Similarly, $\pi(p') = p' \cdot y' \ge p' \cdot y''$, which implies $(1-t) \cdot p' \cdot y' \ge (1-t) \cdot p' \cdot y''$.
    *   Adding these inequalities, we get $t \cdot p \cdot y + (1-t) \cdot p' \cdot y' \ge t \cdot p \cdot y'' + (1-t) \cdot p' \cdot y''$.
    *   This implies $t\pi(p) + (1-t)\pi(p') \ge \pi(p'')$.

4.  **Continuous in $p$:** This ensures that $\pi(p)$ is well-defined.

## Intuitive Understanding of the Properties:

1.  **Homogeneous of degree 1 in prices:** This intuitively means that if all prices are scaled by a factor, the profit also scales by the same factor. For example, if the prices of both outputs and inputs double, the profit will also double. This makes sense because the firm's production possibilities and optimal choices remain the same in real terms.
2.  **Increasing in output prices:** This is intuitive as higher output prices lead to higher revenue for the same quantity of output, thus increasing profits.
3.  **Convexity in prices:** Convexity implies that the firm can take advantage of price fluctuations. The firm can adjust its production plan in response to price changes, leading to higher profits compared to a situation where it sticks to a fixed plan. For instance, if the price of an output increases, the firm can increase its production of that output to take advantage of the higher price. Conversely, if the price of an input increases, the firm can reduce its use of that input or substitute it with a cheaper alternative.
---
## Economic Rationale for Convexity Property

Consider the graph of profits versus the price of the output good.

![internet required to fetch](https://github.com/muzammilafroz/micro/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-10-16%20040409.png?raw=true)

At the price vector $(P^*,w^*)$, suppose the profit-maximizing plan is $(y^*,x^*)$. This leads to a profit of $\pi=p^*y^*-w^*x^*$, where $y^*$, $x^*$, and $w^*$ are unchanged. 
![Internet connection required](https://github.com/muzammilafroz/micro/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-10-16%20040425.png?raw=true)
Suppose $p$ increases, but the firm does not change $(y^*,x^*)$. 
![Internet connection required](https://github.com/muzammilafroz/micro/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-10-16%20040437.png?raw=true)
So, the firm's profit behaves as expressed by a straight line. We call this the **passive profit line** because the firm does not respond to the price increase by changing its optimal $x^*$ or $y^*$.

Now, the profits from pursuing the optimal policy must yield profits as large as the passive profit line. So for every point, except the first point of $(P^*,w^*)$, the profit line must be higher than the passive profit line. Hence $\pi(p)$ is a convex function.

## Practical Implication:

These properties are crucial when analyzing accounting data. For instance, if profits don't scale proportionally when all prices are scaled up, it indicates that the firm is not maximizing profits. This could be due to various reasons such as inefficiencies in production, incorrect price expectations, or managerial constraints.

## Example:

Consider a competitive industry facing a randomly fluctuating output price:

- $p_1$ with probability $q$
- $p_2$ with probability $(1-q)$

How does this affect a typical firm's profits?

Since the profit function is convex, we have:

$\pi(\bar{p}) \le q\pi(p_1) + (1-q)\pi(p_2)$

where $\bar{p} = p_1q + p_2(1-q)$.

This implies that a fluctuating price leads to at least as much profit as a fixed average price. The firm benefits from adjusting its production according to the prevailing price level—expanding when the price is high and vice versa. This flexibility allows the firm to take advantage of favorable price movements and mitigate the impact of unfavorable ones.

---
## Supply and Demand Functions from the Profit Function

The profit function contains all the economically relevant information about the firm's behavior. We can use the profit function to derive the firm's net supply functions.

Suppose we have the firm's supply function $y(p)$. And we want the profit function - what do we do? This is easy. We substitute this into our profit expression and get $\pi(p) = p \cdot y(p)$.

Now, suppose we have the profit function and are asked to find the firm's supply function - How?

We use the **Hotelling's Lemma:**

Let $y_i(p)$ be the firm's net supply function of good $i$. Then:

$y_i(p) = \frac{\partial \pi(p)}{\partial p_i}$ for $i = 1, ..., n$

assuming that this derivative exists and $p_i > 0$.

**Proof:**

Suppose $y^*$ is a profit-maximizing net output vector at prices $p^*$. Then we define a function:

$g(p) = \pi(p) - p \cdot y^*$

Here $\pi(p) = p \cdot y$ is the profit function. Thus, the profit-maximizing plan at price $p$ will be at least as good as $y^*$, since $y^*$ is feasible but not necessarily optimal at prices $p$.

This implies that $g(p) \ge 0$ for all $p$ and $g(p^*) = 0$. Therefore, $g(p)$ attains a minimum at $p = p^*$.

Assuming that $\pi(p)$ is differentiable, the first-order condition for a minimum is:

$\nabla g(p^*) = 0$

This gives us:

$\frac{\partial \pi(p^*)}{\partial p_i} - y_i^* = 0$

or

$y_i^* = \frac{\partial \pi(p^*)}{\partial p_i}$

Since this holds for any price vector $p^*$, we have:

$y_i(p) = \frac{\partial \pi(p)}{\partial p_i}$

This completes the proof.

**Intuitive Explanation:**

Hotelling's Lemma states that the firm's net supply function for a good is equal to the partial derivative of the profit function with respect to the price of that good. Intuitively, this means that a small increase in the price of a good will lead to an increase in the firm's supply of that good, proportional to the derivative of the profit function.

**Implications:**

Hotelling's Lemma is a powerful tool for analyzing firm behavior. It allows us to:

*   Derive the firm's supply function directly from its profit function.
*   Analyze how changes in prices affect the firm's supply decisions.
*   Understand the relationship between the firm's profit-maximizing behavior and its supply function.

**Note:**

The assumption of differentiability of the profit function is crucial for Hotelling's Lemma to hold. If the profit function is not differentiable, the supply function may not be well-defined.

Let us consider a single output and a single input case.

The profit function of a firm can be expressed as:

$\Pi(x) = P \cdot f(x) - w \cdot x$

where:

*   $P$ is the price of the output.
*   $f(x)$ is the production function, representing the output produced using input $x$.
*   $w$ is the price of the input.

The first-order condition (F.O.C) for profit maximization is:

$P \cdot \frac{df(x)}{dx} - w = 0$

This condition gives us the demand function for the input, $x(P,w)$, which represents the optimal amount of input demanded by the firm at given prices $P$ and $w$.

Substituting the demand function back into the profit function, we get:

$\Pi(P,w) = P \cdot f(x(P,w)) - w \cdot x(P,w)$

This is the profit function expressed in terms of the prices of output and input.

Differentiating the profit function with respect to $w$, we get:

$\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial w} = P \cdot \frac{\partial f(x(P,w))}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial w} - w \cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial w} - x(P,w)$

Rearranging and using the F.O.C, we get:

$\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial w} = [P \cdot \frac{\partial f(x(P,w))}{\partial x} - w] \cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial w} - x(P,w) = -x(P,w)$

This result demonstrates the economic rationale behind Hotelling's lemma, which states that the derivative of the profit function with respect to the input price is equal to the negative of the input demand function.

**Economic Rationale:**

When the price of an output increases, there are two effects:

1.  **Direct effect:** The price increase leads to higher profits even at the same level of output. This is because the revenue increases while the cost remains the same.
2.  **Indirect effect:** The increase in price induces the firm to change its level of output by a small amount. This is because the firm wants to take advantage of the higher price by producing more output. However, since the input is already at its profit-maximizing level, the indirect effect will be zero.

This is an application of the **Envelope Theorem**, which states that the derivative of the maximized value of a function with respect to a parameter is equal to the derivative of the objective function with respect to the parameter, holding the choice variables constant at their optimal values.

---

**The Envelope Theorem**

Consider a maximization problem with parameter $a$:

$M(a) = \max_x f(x,a)$

$M(a)$ is the maximized value of the function, which is a function of the parameter $a$.

Let $x(a)$ be the value of $x$ that solves the problem. Then:

$M(a) = f(x(a),a)$

This simply says that the optimized value of the function is equal to the function evaluated at the optimal choice of $x$.

Differentiating both sides with respect to $a$, we get:

$\frac{dM(a)}{da} = \frac{\partial f(x(a),a)}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{dx(a)}{da} + \frac{\partial f(x(a),a)}{\partial a}$

The first term on the right-hand side represents the indirect effect of $a$ on $M(a)$ through the change in the optimal choice of $x$. The second term represents the direct effect of $a$ on $M(a)$, holding $x$ constant at its optimal value.

The Envelope Theorem states that the indirect effect is zero, i.e.,

$\frac{\partial f(x(a),a)}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{dx(a)}{da} = 0$

This is because at the optimal choice of $x$, the derivative of the objective function with respect to $x$ is zero.

Therefore, we have:

$\frac{dM(a)}{da} = \frac{\partial f(x(a),a)}{\partial a}$

This means that the derivative of the maximized value of the function with respect to a parameter is equal to the derivative of the objective function with respect to the parameter, holding the choice variables constant at their optimal values.

#### Applying Hotelling's Lemma to a Simple One-Input, One-Output Profit Maximization

Consider a firm that uses a single input, $x$, to produce a single output, $y$. The firm's production function is $y = f(x)$, and the prices of the output and input are $p$ and $w$, respectively.

The firm's profit function is:

$\pi(p,w) = \max_x [p \cdot f(x) - w \cdot x]$

The first-order condition for profit maximization is:

$p \cdot f'(x) - w = 0$

This condition implicitly defines the firm's demand function for the input, $x(p,w)$.

Applying Hotelling's Lemma, we can find the firm's supply function for the output:

$y(p,w) = \frac{\partial \pi(p,w)}{\partial p} = f(x(p,w))$

This result is intuitive: the firm's supply of output is simply the output produced using the optimal amount of input.

Similarly, we can find the firm's demand function for the input:

$x(p,w) = -\frac{\partial \pi(p,w)}{\partial w} = x(p,w)$

This result confirms that the demand function derived from Hotelling's Lemma is consistent with the demand function obtained from the first-order condition.

**Comparative Statics**

We can use Hotelling's Lemma to analyze the comparative statics of the firm's supply and demand functions. For example, we can examine how the firm's supply of output changes in response to a change in the output price:

$\frac{\partial y(p,w)}{\partial p} = f'(x(p,w)) \cdot \frac{\partial x(p,w)}{\partial p}$

The first term on the right-hand side, $f'(x(p,w))$, is the marginal product of the input. The second term, $\frac{\partial x(p,w)}{\partial p}$, is the derivative of the input demand function with respect to the output price.

Since the marginal product of the input is positive, the sign of $\frac{\partial y(p,w)}{\partial p}$ depends on the sign of $\frac{\partial x(p,w)}{\partial p}$. If the input is a normal good, then $\frac{\partial x(p,w)}{\partial p} > 0$, and the firm's supply of output increases in response to an increase in the output price.

Similarly, we can analyze how the firm's demand for the input changes in response to a change in the input price:

$\frac{\partial x(p,w)}{\partial w} = -\frac{\partial^2 \pi(p,w)}{\partial w^2}$

The right-hand side is the second derivative of the profit function with respect to the input price. If the profit function is concave in the input price, then $\frac{\partial^2 \pi(p,w)}{\partial w^2} < 0$, and the firm's demand for the input decreases in response to an increase in the input price.

**Profit function is homogenous of degree 1 in prices.**

$\pi(tp,tw) = \max_x [tp \cdot f(x) - tw \cdot x]$

$= t \cdot \max_x [p \cdot f(x) - w \cdot x]$

$= t \cdot \pi(p,w)$

This shows that if we multiply both the output price and the input price by a constant factor $t$, the profit also gets multiplied by the same factor $t$. This makes intuitive sense: if all prices are scaled up by the same factor, the firm's production decisions and profits will also scale up proportionally.

Now, differentiate both sides of the above equation with respect to $t$.

$\frac{\partial \pi(tp,tw)}{\partial (tp)} \cdot p + \frac{\partial \pi(tp,tw)}{\partial (tw)} \cdot w = \pi(p,w)$

Set $t = 1$ to get:

$\frac{\partial \pi(p,w)}{\partial p} \cdot p + \frac{\partial \pi(p,w)}{\partial w} \cdot w = \pi(p,w)$

Using Hotelling's Lemma, we can substitute the partial derivatives with the supply and demand functions:

$y(p,w) \cdot p + (-x(p,w)) \cdot w = \pi(p,w)$

This gives us the following identity:

$p \cdot y(p,w) - w \cdot x(p,w) = \pi(p,w)$

This identity simply states that the profit is equal to the revenue minus the cost.


> scaling up all prices by some factor $t$ won't change the optimal choice of the firm!

Profit function is a convex function of $p$.

So, the Hessian matrix must be positive semi-definite matrix.

In a $K$ good case,

$\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial^2 \pi}{\partial p_1^2} & \frac{\partial^2 \pi}{\partial p_1 \partial p_2} \\
\frac{\partial^2 \pi}{\partial p_2 \partial p_1} & \frac{\partial^2 \pi}{\partial p_2^2}
\end{pmatrix}= \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial y_1}{\partial p_1} & \frac{\partial y_1}{\partial p_2} \\
\frac{\partial y_2}{\partial p_1} & \frac{\partial y_2}{\partial p_2}
\end{pmatrix}$

### Le Chatelier's Principle

**Short-run versus long-run response of a firm's supply behavior:**

The long-run response of a firm's supply to a change in price is at least as large as the short-run response, since it has more factors to adjust in the long run.

**Proof:**

Simple case of one output. Input prices are assumed to be fixed, so $\pi$ depends only on the price of the output.

Let $\pi_s(p,z)$ be the short-run profit function, where $z$ is a fixed input in the short run. Let the long-run maximizing demand for $z$ be given by $z(p)$.

So, $\pi_L(p) = \pi_s(p,z(p))$

Let $p^*$ be some output price and $z^* = z(p^*)$ be the optimal long-run demand for $z$ at $p^*$.

Now, long-run profits will always be as large as short-run profits. Why? Because even the restricted factor can be adjusted in the long run.

So, $h(p) = \pi_L(p) - \pi_s(p,z^*) = \pi_s(p,z(p)) - \pi_s(p,z^*) \ge 0$ for all prices $p$.

At $p^*$, $h(p^*) = 0$ and $h(p) \ge 0$ for all $p$. So, the function $h(p)$ reaches a minimum at $p^*$.

Therefore, the first-order condition (F.O.C) is:

$\frac{dh(p^*)}{dp} = 0$

And the second-order condition (S.O.C) is:

$\frac{d^2h(p^*)}{dp^2} \ge 0$

This implies:

$\frac{\partial^2 \pi_L(p^*)}{\partial p^2} - \frac{\partial^2 \pi_s(p^*,z^*)}{\partial p^2} \ge 0$

$\Rightarrow \frac{\partial y_L}{\partial p}(p^*) - \frac{\partial y_s}{\partial p}(p^*,z^*) \ge 0$

Hence, the long-run supply response to a change in price is at least as large as the short-run supply response at $z^* = z(p^*)$.

Profit function is homogenous of degree 1 in prices.

$\pi(tp,tw) = \max_x [tp \cdot f(x) - tw \cdot x]$

$= t \cdot \max_x [p \cdot f(x) - w \cdot x]$

$= t \cdot \pi(p,w)$

So, $\frac{\partial \pi(tp)}{\partial (tp)} = \frac{\partial \pi(p)}{\partial p}$

> scaling up all prices by some factor $t$ won't change the optimal choice of the firm!

Profit function is a convex function of $p$.

So, the Hessian matrix must be positive semi-definite matrix.

\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial y_1}{\partial p_1} & \frac{\partial y_1}{\partial p_2} \\
\frac{\partial y_2}{\partial p_1} & \frac{\partial y_2}{\partial p_2}
\end{pmatrix}$

### Le Chatelier's Principle

**Short-run versus long-run response of a firm's supply behavior:**

The long-run response of a firm's supply to a change in price is at least as large as the short-run response, since it has more factors to adjust in the long run.

**Proof:**

Simple case of one output. Input prices are assumed to be fixed, so $\pi$ depends only on the price of the output.

Let $\pi_s(p,z)$ be the short-run profit function, where $z$ is a fixed input in the short run. Let the long-run maximizing demand for $z$ be given by $z(p)$.

So, $\pi_L(p) = \pi_s(p,z(p))$

Let $p^*$ be some output price and $z^* = z(p^*)$ be the optimal long-run demand for $z$ at $p^*$.

Now, long-run profits will always be as large as short-run profits. Why? Because even the restricted factor can be adjusted in the long run.

So, $h(p) = \pi_L(p) - \pi_s(p,z^*) = \pi_s(p,z(p)) - \pi_s(p,z^*) \ge 0$ for all prices $p$.

At $p^*$, $h(p^*) = 0$ and $h(p) \ge 0$ for all $p$. So, the function $h(p)$ reaches a minimum at $p^*$.

Therefore, the first-order condition (F.O.C) is:

$\frac{dh(p^*)}{dp} = 0$

And the second-order condition (S.O.C) is:

$\frac{d^2h(p^*)}{dp^2} \ge 0$

This implies:

$\frac{\partial^2 \pi_L(p^*)}{\partial p^2} - \frac{\partial^2 \pi_s(p^*,z^*)}{\partial p^2} \ge 0$

$\Rightarrow \frac{\partial y_L}{\partial p}(p^*) - \frac{\partial y_s}{\partial p}(p^*,z^*) \ge 0$

Hence, the long-run supply response to a change in price is at least as large as the short-run supply response at $z^* = z(p^*)$.

# Chapter 4: Cost Minimization

## Introduction
In this chapter, we examine the behavior of a cost-minimizing firm.

### Why are we interested in cost minimization?

- **Supply behavior**: It provides another way to understand the supply behavior of a firm facing **competitive output markets**.
- **Non-competitive markets**: It allows us to model the production behavior of a firm that **does not** face competitive output markets.

## Cost Minimization Problem

We will formalize the problem of minimizing cost while producing a given level of output:

$$
\min c = w \cdot x \quad \text{subject to} \quad f(x) = y
$$

Where:
- $c$: total cost
- $w$: vector of input prices
- $x$: vector of input quantities
- $f(x)$: production function
- $y$: level of output

### Lagrangian Formulation

We analyze this constrained minimization problem using the **Lagrangian method**. The Lagrangian is:

$$
L(\lambda, x) = w \cdot x + \lambda [y - f(x)]
$$

Where:
- $( \lambda )$: the **Lagrange multiplier** (shadow price)
- $w \cdot x$: total cost
- $y - f(x)$: constraint, where $y$ is the given output level, and $f(x)$ is the production function

We minimize this Lagrangian with respect to the choice variables $x$ and the Lagrange multiplier $( \lambda )$.

### First Order Conditions (F.O.C)

The first-order conditions for minimizing cost are:

$$
w_i - \lambda \frac{\partial f(x^*)}{\partial x_i} = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad i = 1, 2, ..., n
$$

In vector notation:

$$
w = \lambda Df(x^*)
$$

Where:
- $Df(x^*)$: vector of marginal products of each input
- $w$: vector of input prices

### Interpretation of First Order Conditions

For each pair of inputs $i$ and $j$ from $i, j \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}$, we interpret the F.O.C as:

$$
\frac{w_i}{w_j} = \frac{\frac{\partial f(x^*)}{\partial x_i}}{\frac{\partial f(x^*)}{\partial x_j}}
$$

This equation expresses the equality between the **economic rate of substitution** and the **technical rate of substitution**.

### Technical Rate of Substitution (TRS)

The **technical rate of substitution (TRS)** refers to the rate at which factor $i$ can be substituted for factor $j$ while maintaining the same level of output:

$$
TRS_{ij} = \frac{\partial f(x^*) / \partial x_i}{\partial f(x^*) / \partial x_j}
$$

### Economic Rate of Substitution

The **economic rate of substitution (ERS)** is the rate at which factor $j$ can be substituted for factor $i$ while keeping total costs constant:

$$
ERS_{ij} = \frac{w_i}{w_j}
$$

Thus, the first-order condition shows that at the cost-minimizing point, the **economic rate of substitution** equals the **technical rate of substitution**:

$$
ERS_{ij} = TRS_{ij}
$$

This implies that the firm is minimizing its costs by choosing the optimal combination of inputs such that the marginal rate of technical substitution is aligned with the ratio of input prices.

---
## Cost Minimization: Second Order Conditions (S.O.C)

### First Order Condition (F.O.C)

The **economic rate of substitution** equals the **technical rate of substitution**.

### Second Order Condition (S.O.C)

For the **second-order condition** to hold, the **bordered Hessian** must be **negative semi-definite**.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -Df(x) \\
-Df(x)^T & -\lambda D^2f(x)
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Where $D^2f(x)$ is the Hessian matrix of $f(x)$.

### Difficulties:

1. **Non-differentiability**: What if $f(x)$ is not differentiable? (e.g., **Leontief technology**).
2. **Corner solutions**: What if $x^*_i = 0$ for some $i$? In such cases, we need to use the **Kuhn-Tucker Theorem**.

## Further Explanation of F.O.C

The **economic rate of substitution** equals the **technical rate of substitution**.

Suppose:

$$
\frac{w_i}{w_j} = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad TRS = 1
$$

Then $ERS > TRS$. This implies that we should use **one less unit of factor $i$** and **one more unit of factor $j$**. This change keeps the output level constant but reduces the cost. Here's why:

- By using one less unit of factor $i$, we save **two units of money** (as the price of factor $i$ is higher).
- By using one more unit of factor $j$, we only face an **additional cost of one unit** of money.

Thus, we save on costs by adjusting the input mix, meaning we are **not yet cost-minimizing**.

### Isocost Line

The isocost line is given by:

$$
C = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2
$$

We can rewrite this as:

$$
x_2 = \frac{C}{w_2} - \frac{w_1}{w_2} x_1
$$

The slope of the isocost line is:

$$
\left| \frac{w_1}{w_2} \right|
$$

### Isoquant

For a given level of output $y$, the **isoquant** is defined as $f(x_1, x_2) = y$. The slope of the isoquant is the **technical rate of substitution (TRS)**. Equilibrium occurs at the point of **tangency**, where:

$$
\left| \frac{w_1}{w_2} \right| = |TRS|
$$

### Second Order Condition (S.O.C) for Cost Minimization

The **Lagrangian** for cost minimization is:

$$
L = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 - \lambda [f(x_1, x_2) - y]
$$

The **second-order condition** involves the **Hessian matrix**:

$$
D^2 L(x_1^*, x_2^*, \lambda^*) = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial x_1^2} & \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} & \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial x_1 \partial \lambda} \\
\frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial x_2 \partial x_1} & \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial x_2^2} & \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial x_2 \partial \lambda} \\
\frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial \lambda \partial x_1} & \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial \lambda \partial x_2} & \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial \lambda^2}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This can be simplified as:

$$
D^2 L(x_1^*, x_2^*, \lambda^*) = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial x_1^2} & \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} & -f_1 \\
\frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial x_2 \partial x_1} & \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial x_2^2} & -f_2 \\
-f_1 & -f_2 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

If $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} = f_{ij}$, then:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -f_1 & -f_2 \\
-f_1 & -\lambda f_{11} & -\lambda f_{12} \\
-f_2 & -\lambda f_{21} & -\lambda f_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This is the **bordered Hessian matrix**. The **S.O.C for cost minimization** requires that the **determinant of the bordered Hessian** be **negative**.

## Difficulties in Cost Minimization

For each choice of $w$ and $y$, there will be some choice of $x^*$ that minimizes the cost of producing $y$ units of output. This $x(w, y)$ is called the **conditional factor demand function**, as it depends on both the level of output and the input prices.

The **cost function** represents the minimal cost at the factor prices $w$ and output level $y$:

$$
c(w, y) = w \cdot x(w, y)
$$

### When Do the F.O.C Get Violated?

1. **Non-differentiable technology**: If the production function is not differentiable (e.g., **Leontief technology**).
   
2. **Boundary solutions (corner solutions)**: The F.O.C makes sense only for **interior solutions**, not for **boundary solutions**. In the case of corner solutions:

$$
\lambda \frac{\partial f(x^*)}{\partial x_i} \leq w_i, \quad x_i \geq 0
$$

If $x_i > 0$, then:

$$
\lambda \frac{\partial f(x^*)}{\partial x_i} = w_i
$$

3. **Existence and uniqueness**: The issues related to the **existence** and **uniqueness** of the profit-maximizing bundle do not arise in the context of cost minimization.
